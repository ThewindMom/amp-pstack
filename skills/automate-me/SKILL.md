# Automate me

A guided flow for turning the user's working conventions into a skill agents will follow. The output is one `-mode` skill tailored to them (e.g. `jay-mode`, `priya-mode`).

This skill orchestrates an Amp thread-history mining pass, Amp's built-in `building-skills` workflow, and the **unslop** skill. It sequences them; it doesn't replace them.

## Flow

### 0. Check for an existing skill

Look for project skills under `.agents/skills/` and personal skills in Amp's configured user skills location, matching the user's handle. If one exists, confirm intent unless they already asked to update it:

- Update the existing skill (default for repeat runs)
- Start fresh (rare; ask why before doing it)

Update mode changes the rest of the flow:
- Step 1 mines only history since the skill was last edited (`git log -1 --format=%cI <path>`).
- Step 2 asks what's changed or missing, not what to capture from zero.
- Step 4 edits the existing file in place. Preserve sections the user hasn't contradicted; revise ones with new evidence; add new sections only for genuinely new rules.

### 1. Mine their history

Use `find_thread` to search the active project or repository and the requested date range. Read relevant conversations with `read_thread`. For a large result set, run parallel `pstack_start_agent` calls with role `how-explorer` over non-overlapping thread-ID slices. Join on the reports. Each miner returns recurring patterns with Amp thread links. Default signals worth hunting:

- Response preferences (length, tone, format, "dumb it down" corrections)
- Delegation habits (subagents, models, specialized workflows, parallelism)
- Verification posture (what "done" means; unit tests vs live repro; reviewers)
- Code and prose discipline (style, principles cited, lint/format tools)
- Process conventions (worktrees, commits, PRs, review/merge tooling)
- Meta preferences (fixing skills mid-task, proposing new ones)

Cross-check across slices before elevating a signal. Patterns seen in 2+ slices are high-confidence; lone signals are weak and usually get dropped.

### 2. Ask the user directly

Mining misses intent that hasn't come up yet. Ask one or two concise multi-choice questions when the client supports structured questions; otherwise use short numbered choices.

Shape: one or two questions with 4-6 options each, `allow_multiple: true` for category questions. Start broad ("Which areas matter most?"), then follow up on selected areas with specific options. After the structured rounds, one free-form chat question catches anything the options missed.

Don't dump 20 questions. Two structured rounds plus one open question is usually enough.

### 3. Cluster findings

Group the combined signals into sections. Common ones (use only what applies):

- **Response style**: length, tone, format.
- **Autonomy**: how much to do without asking; MCP tool use.
- **Understand first**: which skills to reach for when scoping or investigating a change.
- **Subagents**: default, parallelism, model-to-task, specialized workflows.
- **Prose / code discipline**: principles, lint tools, style guides.
- **Review and verify**: repro posture, verification skills, live-testing tools.
- **Process**: git worktrees, commits, PRs, review/merge tooling.
- **Skills**: skill-authoring habits, fix-the-skill-first, proposing new skills.

The **poteto-mode** skill shows the shape. Read it for granularity. Don't copy its content; the user's rules are not the same as poteto-mode's.

### 4. Draft the skill

Load Amp's built-in `building-skills` skill before authoring. Placement:

- Path: preserve an existing skill's category. For a new project skill, use `.agents/skills/<handle>-mode/SKILL.md`. Use the personal skill location only when the user wants it available across projects.
- Handle: the user's first name or chosen identifier.
- Frontmatter `description`: trigger on their name, the qualified skill name, and "work in their style", not generic phrases such as "write code" or "review PR".
- Frontmatter formatting: follow `building-skills`. Keep `description` as one YAML scalar.

### 5. Iterate on prose

Apply the **unslop** skill and `building-skills` guidance to every line. Both apply to any agent-read prose, not just skills.

Show the draft to the user and take feedback. Expect multiple iterations. Cut ruthlessly; a mode skill is not a manual.

### 6. Land it

For project skills, use the repository's normal review workflow. For personal skills, show the draft and require approval before installing or replacing it. Reload skills after an approved change.

## Guardrails

- **Don't overfit to one conversation.** A preference stated once and contradicted another time is noise. Require multiple instances before codifying it.
- **Don't be clever.** Restating other skills' contents, inventing metaphors, or writing "poetic" prose for an agent reader is cost without benefit. Keep it operational.
- **Reference, don't inline.** Other skills the user relies on should appear as path references, not pasted excerpts. Same for any principle docs they maintain elsewhere.
- **Keep sections minimal.** Only add a section if the user has a specific, non-default rule there. "Communicate clearly" is not a section. "Short paragraphs. Tables when comparing options. Bullets only when items are genuinely parallel." is.
- **Name conventions generic.** Use "the user" or "the human" in imperatives, not the author's first name. Others may read or adopt the skill.
- **Don't force symmetry.** If a user has no process rules worth writing down, skip the Process section entirely. Sparse is fine; bloated is not.

## Evaluation

A `-mode` skill is subjective output. A `create-skill`-style test/iterate benchmark loop isn't useful here. Vibe-check with the user: does it read like them? Did it miss anything? Then ship.

Run a description-optimization loop only if the skill's trigger accuracy turns out to be a problem in practice.

## When not to use

- User wants a task-specific skill (not working conventions): `create-skill` alone, no mining required.
- User wants to capture one narrow workflow (e.g. "how I write commit messages"): that's a regular skill, not a mode skill.

## Reference files

- The **poteto-mode** skill: example of the output shape.
- The **unslop** skill: prose discipline for every line.
- Amp's built-in `building-skills` skill: skill authoring, placement, validation, installation, and reload workflow.
